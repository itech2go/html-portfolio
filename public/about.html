<h2>Hi! I'm Lotess Airah!!</h2>
<p align = justify>I graduated with a Degree of Bachelor of Science in Information System in the Philippines. Right after
   graduating college I started working as a Customer Assistant, I was really interested in getting my hands on some 
   experience and earn your own hardwork. After a year im hired as a Payroll Staff in one of the company. Through this job
   I learned to become a flexible, working well with others and 
   Im 29 years of age now and i have two lovely kids and a husband. 
   I've been here in United States of America since December 2019.</p>
